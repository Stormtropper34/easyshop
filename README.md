# easyshop
For this project you will assume the role of a backend developer for an existing
website. The website is already operational and has been published as Version 1.
EasyShop is ready to begin development on Version 2.
The website uses a Spring Boot API project for the backend server, with a
MySQL database for data storage. You will be given the existing project code to
modify. The starter code also includes the database script for the existing data
structure
